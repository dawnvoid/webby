# Webby

A Minecraft datapack that makes spiders web you.

- for 1.19.x
- multiplayer/singleplayer compatible
- minimal risk (uses 1 custom invisible achievement, shouldn't corrupt anything)

## Why?

- vanilla monsters are too easy to fight
- being able to web you makes spiders combo well with skeletons and creepers

## Why not?

- after a rough night, there might be cobwebs everywhere

## Installation

2. load it into your Minecraft world
